The problem-solving process for this project began with understanding what I wanted to predict and determining which pieces of information, like age, height, and exercise level, would be important for making that prediction. This required me to closely examine the dataset and apply some basic knowledge about health factors that influence weight. Once I understood the problem, I moved on to data preparation, which involved cleaning the data. This meant fixing any missing or incorrect information and ensuring that everything was in the right format. Proper data preparation was crucial for building an effective model.
Next, I selected Linear Regression as my model because it is simple and easy to interpret. Using this model allowed me not only to make predictions but also to see how different factors relate to the weight of individuals. After training the model, I evaluated its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which gave me a number to assess how accurate my predictions were. By analyzing the results, I could identify areas for improvement, such as selecting better features or trying out more advanced modeling techniques.
In conclusion, this project highlighted the importance of following a systematic approach to problem-solving in data science. The ability to iteratively refine the model and reflect on my process proved invaluable for achieving better predictive performance in real-world applications.
